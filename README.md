# Sample Projects for GRAKN.AI

This repo contains sample projects that are used to illustrate features of Grakn. Some projects use Java, while others use Graql.

Additional information about each can be found as described below, and within each folder.


### [example-analytics-MTCars](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-analytics-mtcars)

A simple Graql-based example that takes the MTCars dataset, familiar to users of R, and illustrates how to use GRAKN.AI to perform basic analytics. The documentation for this example can be found [here](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/examples/analytics.html).

### CSV Migration

We provide several examples of [CSV migration](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/migration/CSV-migration.html): 
   
* The genealogy data used across our example set is migrated from CSV in the [example-csv-migration-genealogy](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-csv-migration-genealogy) project. The documentation can be found [here](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/examples/CSV-migration.html).
* CSV migration is covered in a [blog post](https://blog.grakn.ai/twenty-years-of-games-in-grakn-14faa974b16e#.cuox3cew2), for which the associated sample code can be found in in the [example-csv-migration-games](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-csv-migration-games) project.
* There is a further CSV migration example that takes a simple CSV data file of pets in the [example-csv-migration-pets](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-csv-migration-pets) project. Please see the [readme file](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/blob/master/example-csv-migration-pets/README.md) to get started.  

### [example-graph-api-genealogy](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-graph-api-genealogy)

An example of using the Java Graph API to build an ontology and load data, plus some simple queries on the data using the Java Graql API (which will be extended to a more complete example in due course). Further information about the example is available in the [documentation](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/developing-with-java/graph-api.html).

### [example-JSON-migration-giphy](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-json-migration)

This is an example of JSON migration using the Java API. 

JSON migration using the Graql migration script is covered further in the [Grakn documentation portal](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/migration/JSON-migration.html).

### [example-OWL-migration](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-owl-migration)

The is an example of [OWL migration example](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/examples/OWL-migration.html) using the Java API. For further information, please see the [Grakn documentation portal](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/migration/OWL-migration.html).

### [example-SQL-migration](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-sql-migration)

This is an example of [SQL migration using the Java API](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/examples/SQL-migration.html). 

Please see the [Grakn documentation portal](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/migration/SQL-migration.html) for a worked example of SQL migration using the Graql migration script.
